# Accounts-Receivable
Accounts Receivable (A/R) is the money owed to a business by its clients. The main
objective in Accounts Receivable management is to minimise the Days Sales
Outstanding (DSO) and processing costs whilst maintaining good customer relations.
Accounts receivable is often the biggest current asset on the balance sheet. Indeed in
many small and medium-sized businesses receivables represents the majority of
working capital. The other key objective in A/R management is to use systems and
processes that ensure that the financing potential of the company's receivables can be
maximised. Before any invoice or bill can be sent out companies need to determine
how to charge for the product or service they provide, Americans call this
Relationship Monetization. As products and services become more and more
complex, this has become much more difficult. Furthermore, there increasing number
of regulations and rules requiring companies to be able to fully itemise and justify
their invoices/bills. Today invoices need to show how the full charge is built up. And
the multiple parties involved in delivering the service, and each require their share of
the income generated. There are now companies and software packages specifically
designed to monetize relationships and manage these complex billing arrangements.
